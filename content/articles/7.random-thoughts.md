### James Cameron

After watching the documentary, I discovered that James Cameron is one of my newfound people of inspiration. He had a dream of doing a near impossible task, travelling to the Challenger Deep. Not only did he help lead the way to building an incredible submersible vehicle, but he also put his life on the line for science and because it was his dream! There are absolutely forces in this world that attempt to keep you from following dreams, but I believe those forces or people are the ones you have to push through in order to achieve your dream. Dreams come in many forms, but those that fight everything that tell you No are the dreams that make it into reality. Quite possibly, it's an external force that causes us to feel as though we shouldn't pursue certain tasks in an attempt to see if it's really worth it. Having the universe on your side and the countless invisible beings that are observing us can help immensely, but I think you have to want it.
