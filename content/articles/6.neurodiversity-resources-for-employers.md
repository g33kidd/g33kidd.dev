# Neurodiversity Resources for Employers

Well, this is quite interesting. I **was** working on this document to present to a former employer that promptly disregarded that I had even mentioned doing research for them to ensure that their employees are well taken care of, and so others may have better opportunities in the future. Nevertheless, I will continue to work towards being able to provide people like myself unique opportunities in STEM and for the sake of empowering the future of humanity.
